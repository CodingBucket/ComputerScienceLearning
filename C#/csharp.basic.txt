# Types:
  Value Types - int, float, double, structs, enums etc.
  Reference Types - Interface, Class, delegates, array etc.

# Implicit conversion:
  Implicit conversion is done by the compiler
  where there is no loss of informationif the conversion is done.
  If there is no possibility of throwing exceptions during the conversion.
  
# Explicit conversion:
  When converting a float to an int, we loose the fractional part and also a possibility of 
  overflow exception. Hence, in this case an explicit conversion is required. For explicit
  conversion we can use cast operator or the convert class in c#.
  
# Static Constructor:
  Static constructor are used to initialize static fields in a class. 
  Static constructor is called only once, no metter how many instances you create.
  Static constructor is called before the instance constructor.
  
# Pillars of Object Oriented Programming:
  1. Inheritance.
  2. Encapsulation.
  3. Abstraction.
  4. Polymorphism.
  
# Polymorphism:
  Polymorphism allows you to invoke derived class methods through a base class reference during runtime.
  In the base class the method is declared as virtual, and in the derived class we override the same method.
  The virtual keyword indicates, the method can be overridden in any derived class.
  
# Method Overriding:
  In method overriding a base class reference variable pointing to a child class object,
  will invoke the overridden method in the child class.
  It is also called Polymorphism.

# Method Hidding:
  In method overriding a base class reference variable pointing to a child class object,
  will invoke the hidden  method in the base class.
  
# Method Overloadnig:
  Method overloading allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name, 
  but differnet types and numbers of paramenter. It is not possiable to overload a function
  based on the return type of a method.	
  
# Auto Implemented Properties:
  If there is no editional logic in the property accessors, then we can make use of auto-implemneted properties introduced in C# 3.0
  Auto-impplemented properties reduce the amount of code that we have to write. When you use auto-implemented properties, 
  the complier creates a private, anonymous field that can only accessed through the property's get and set accessors.
  
# Structs:
  Structs are very similar to classes. We use struct keyword to create a struct.
  Just like classes structs can have fields, properties, constructors and methods.
  
# Class Vs Struct:
  => A struct is a value type where as a class is a reference typess.
  => Structs are stored on stack, where as classes are strored on heap.
  => Value type are destroyed immediately after the scope is lost, where as for reference types only
  => the reference variable is destroyed after the scope is lost. The object is later destroyed by garbage
     collector.
  => When you copy a struct into another struct, a new copy of that struct gets created and modifications on one 
     struct will not affect the values contained by the other struct.
  => When you copy a class into another class, we only get a copy of the reference variable. Both the reference
     variables point to the same object on the heap. So, operations on one variable will affect the values 
     contained by the other reference variable.
  => Structs cant have destructor, but classes can have destructor.
  => Structs cannot have explicit parameter less constructor where as a class can.
  => Struct cant inherit from another class where as a class can,Both structs and class
     can inherit from an interface.
  => Example of structs in the .NET Framework - int (System.Int32), double (System.double) etc.
  => A class or a struct cannot inherit from another class from being struct. Structs are sealed types.
  
# Interface:
  => We create interface using interface keyword. Just like classes interfaces also contains properties,
     methods, delegates or event, but only declarations and no implementations.
  => Interface members are public by default, and they dont allow explicit access modifiers.
  => If a strucs or a class inherits from a interface, it must provide implementation for all interface methods.
  => We can not create an instance of an interface, but an interface reference variable can point to a derived
     class object.
     
# Abstract Class:
  => The abstract keyword is used to create abstract classes.
  => An abstract class is incomplete and hence cannot be instantiated.
  => An abstract class can only be used as base class.
  => An abstract class cannot be sealed.
  => An abstract class may contain abstract members, but not mandatory.
  => A non-abstract class derived from an abstract class must provide implementations for 
     inherided abstract members.

# Abstract Class VS Interface:
  => Abstract class can have implementation for some of its members,but the interface
     cant have implementation for any of its members.
  => Interface cannot have fields where as an abstract class can have fields.
  => An interface can inherit from another interface only,where as an abstract class
     can inherit from abstract class or interface.
  => Abstract class members can have access modifiers where as interface member can
     not have access modifier.
     
# Multiple Class Inheritance Problem:
  1. Class B and Class C inherit from class A.
  2. Class D inherits from both B and C.
  3. If a method in D call a method defined in A(and does not override the method), and B and C
     have overridden that method that differently, then from which class does it inherit: B, or C?
  => This ambiguity is called as Diamond problem.
  
# Delegate:
  => A delegate is a type safe function pointer. It holds a reference of a function.
  => The signature of the delegate must match the signature of the function, the delegate
     points to, otherwise you get a complier error.This is the reason delegates are called as type
     safe function pointers.
  => A delegate is similar to a class.You can create an instance of it,and when you do so,you pass
     the function name as a parameter to the delegate constructor, and it is the function the delegate
     will call.
  => Delegates syntax look very much similar to a method with a delegate keyword.
