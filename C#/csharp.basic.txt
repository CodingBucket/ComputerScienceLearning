# Types:
  Value Types - int, float, double, structs, enums etc.
  Reference Types - Interface, Class, delegates, array etc.

# Implicit conversion:
  Implicit conversion is done by the compiler
  where there is no loss of informationif the conversion is done.
  If there is no possibility of throwing exceptions during the conversion.
  
# Explicit conversion:
  When converting a float to an int, we loose the fractional part and also a possibility of 
  overflow exception. Hence, in this case an explicit conversion is required. For explicit
  conversion we can use cast operator or the convert class in c#.
  
# Static Constructor:
  Static constructor are used to initialize static fields in a class. 
  Static constructor is called only once, no metter how many instances you create.
  Static constructor is called before the instance constructor.
  
# Pillars of Object Oriented Programming:
  1. Inheritance.
  2. Encapsulation.
  3. Abstraction.
  4. Polymorphism.
  
# Polymorphism:
  Polymorphism allows you to invoke derived class methods through a base class reference during runtime.
  In the base class the method is declared as virtual, and in the derived class we override the same method.
  The virtual keyword indicates, the method can be overridden in any derived class.
  
# Method Overriding:
  In method overriding a base class reference variable pointing to a child class object,
  will invoke the overridden method in the child class.
  It is also called Polymorphism.

# Method Hidding:
  In method overriding a base class reference variable pointing to a child class object,
  will invoke the hidden  method in the base class.
