# Types:
  Value Types - int, float, double, structs, enums etc.
  Reference Types - Interface, Class, delegates, array etc.

# Implicit conversion:
  Implicit conversion is done by the compiler
  where there is no loss of informationif the conversion is done.
  If there is no possibility of throwing exceptions during the conversion.
  
# Explicit conversion:
  When converting a float to an int, we loose the fractional part and also a possibility of 
  overflow exception. Hence, in this case an explicit conversion is required. For explicit
  conversion we can use cast operator or the convert class in c#.
