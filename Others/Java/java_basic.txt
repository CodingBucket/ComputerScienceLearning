# Class:	
	Class is a blueprint of an object

# Object:
	Object is an instance of a class which has all property that the class has
	In java object is created in heap memory and other variable and method stay 
	in stack memory.

	Object Creation in java

	A obj = new A();

	a. A is the object type.
	b. obj is the object reference it canbe any name.
	c. new is which create the object in the heap memory this memory is equal to A class memory.
	d. A() is the constructor method od the A class.
	e. obj stay in the stack memory which is reference type variable.

# Class Variable:
	What class khows is called class variable

# Class Method:
	What class does is called class method.

# Variable:
	variable is which store data.There are two types of variable

	a. Reference type variable.
	b. Premitive type variable.

# Constructor:
	
	a. Constructor is a member method.
	b. Constructor has the same name of class name.
	c. Constructor does return anything.
	d. It is used to allocate memory.

# Access modifier:
	
	a. Private : canbe accessed form the specific class
	b. Default : Canbe accessed from specific package.
	c. Public : Canbe accessed from any class or any package.
	d. Protected : Canbe accessed for subsiding class.

# Static method:
	Static method of a class canbe called without creating object of a class

# Final:

	a. final variable : the value of final variable can not be changed.
	b. final method : final method cannot be overwritten. 
	c. final class : final class can not be extented.

# Abstraction :
	A class with atleeast one abstract class is called abstract class.
	
	a. abstract methods are methods that can only be declared, not defined.
	b. abstract class can have abstract method.
	c. you can not create objects of abstract class.
	d. in abstract class you can define method.

# Interface :

	a. in interface you can declare a method like abstract class.
	b. in interface you can not define a method.
	c. all the methods in interface is abstruct method.

	There three types of interface
	
		a. Marker Interface : without any method.
		b. SAM : single abstract method. In java 1.8 it is also called Functional Interface.
		c. Normal Inteface

# Inner Class:
	
	1. Member class
	2. Nested class
	3. Anonymous class
	4. Lamda
