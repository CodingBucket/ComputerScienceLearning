1. Class:
   Class is blueprint of an object.

2. Object:
   Object is instance of a class. object has all the properties of the class.

3. Inheritance:
   When one class acquires all the properties and behaviours of parent class then it is called inheritance.
   sub or child class get all the methods from the super or paren class.
   there are three kinds of inheritence
   
      a. Single level inheritence.
    
      b. Multi level inheritence.
    
      c. Multiple inheritence. (In java multiple inheritence is not supported,we can use inteerface for this)

4. Polymorphism:
   poly means many and morphism means behabiour. In polymorphism same function can be used for different purposes
   there are two types of polymorphism.
  
      a. Method overloding:
         multiple method in the same class but with different parameter.
    
      b. Method overriding:
         when super class and the sub class have the same method then the super class method will be overridden by 
         the sub class method it is called method overriding.

      c. Dynamic method dispatch
 
5. Encapsulation:
   In encapsulation the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only through
   the methods of their current class. Encapsulation can be achived by making the variable or method private.
   
      Access Specifier in java
   
         Private : private variable or method only canbe accessed form its own class.
   
         Protected : protected variable or method only canbe accessed by its own class and inherited class.
   
         Public : public variable or method canbe accessed from any class

6. Abstraction:
	A class with at least one abstract method is called abstract class.
	
	a. abstract methods are methods that can only be declared, not defined.
	b. abstract class can have abstract method.
	c. you can not create objects of abstract class.
	d. in abstract class you can define method.
