# Interface :

   a. in interface you can declare a method like abstract class.
   b. in interface you can not define a method.
   c. all the methods in interface is abstruct method.

   There three types of interface
   
      a. Marker Interface : without any method.
      b. SAM : single abstract method. In java 1.8 it is also called Functional Interface.
      c. Normal Inteface

# Interface:

   1. Used as an alternative for multiple inheritance.

   2. Contains methods with no bodies.

   3. You can not create objects of an interface.

   4. Subclasss must provides an implementation of all the methods of the interface.

   5. Use only constant variables inside an interface. No instance variable.

   6. When you have both an extends clause and an implements clause the extends clause is always first.

   7. Implementing an interface is like signing a contract with the compiler thet stats
      "I will declare all the methods specified by the interface or I will declare my class abstract".

   8. Interface does not have constructor method.

   9. If an interface variable refers to an object, then the object must belong to same class that
      implements that interface.
