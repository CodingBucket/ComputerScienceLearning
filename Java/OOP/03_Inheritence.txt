## Inheritance:
   When one class acquires all the properties and behaviours of parent class then it is called inheritance.
   sub or child class get all the methods from the super or paren class.
   there are three kinds of inheritence
   
      a. Single level inheritence.
    
      b. Multi level inheritence.
    
      c. Multiple inheritence. (In java multiple inheritence is not supported,we can use inteerface for this)
